# toonrail
Pet project to learn ruby on rails. The project idea is to create a website for MidCity along the lines of other web comic websites. MidCity is a future pet project I have thought about every now and again. Once the website functionality is acceptable, I plan to create a customizable site usable by any web comic creator.
